## What is filenotes?
Filenotes is a note taking app which uses plain old files and directories to
avoid lock-in with proprietory formats. Create and edit text files, view images
and play audio; organise your files in directories, choose how to sort, search
content and titles, autoname files, automatically sync updates, use your system
theme (or override) and, of course, it works offline so long as you are using a
browser built after 2017. You don't even need to install it (although you won't
get offline access).

## At a glance

* Open file format - no lock in
  * Text files (.txt .md)

* Optional background sync

## Sync your data

Sync files with Dropbox in its own scoped directory (~/Apps/filenotes.app/).
Open the files on your device with the Dropbox app, notepad, vi or emacs. Sync
is fast because Filenotes keeps track of changes, versions and file hashes and
it will avoid overwriting conflicts.

## Privacy

Your data is your own. Data is stored in the browser - you can find it, if
you're so inclined, in your local IndexedDB. And it is synced with Dropbox. No
data is stored on the Filenotes servers, There is no tracking, no adverts, no
telemetry, no cookies and so no annoying popups. Awesome.
